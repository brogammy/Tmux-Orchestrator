## Browser Support

‚úÖ **Works Best:**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Support:**

## Tips

1. **Speak clearly** - The better the audio quality, the better the transcription
2. **Use short phrases** - "show status" works better than long sentences
3. **Wait for processing** - Give it a second after speaking
4. **Check permissions** - Browser may ask for microphone access (allow it)
5. **Use microphone icon** - Click it to start, click again to stop

## Advanced Features

### Voice History
The system keeps the last 5 commands you spoke. Each shows:
- The exact words transcribed
- Confidence score (0-100%)
- Time of command
- Status (received/sent/executed)

### Export History
(Developer feature) Download full voice history as JSON for analysis

### Session Management
Each session gets a unique ID. You can track commands across sessions.

## API Integration

### For Developers

The voice module sends transcribed commands to:
```
POST /api/execute-command
{
  "command": "show status"
}
```

The API returns:
```json
{
  "response": "System is running normally",
  "status": "success"
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does the system hear me if I don't click the button?**
A: No, push-to-talk mode requires you to click the button to start recording.

**Q: Is my voice saved anywhere?**
A: No, voice is processed by Google's servers but not stored. Command history is saved in your browser only.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile?**
A: Yes, iOS Safari 14.1+ and Android Chrome work.

**Q: How long can I talk?**
A: Maximum 30 seconds per recording. For longer commands, record multiple times.

**Q: Can I use multiple languages?**
A: Yes, select language before recording. But switch before recording, not during.

**Q: What happens if the network is slow?**
A: Transcription might take longer, but it will eventually complete.
