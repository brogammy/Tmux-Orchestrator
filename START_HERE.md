# 👋 START HERE - Multi-Agency System

**Welcome back!** You're switching from SSH to physical access. Here's what you need to know:

---

## ✅ What's Running RIGHT NOW

### CodeAgency is LIVE

```bash
# Attach to see it
tmux attach -t CodeAgency
```

**Windows:**
- Window 0: **Coordinator** (Claude running, operational, waiting for you)
- Window 1: python-agent (ready to deploy)
- Window 2: js-agent (ready to deploy)
- Window 3: code-reviewer (ready to deploy)
- Window 4: tools
- Window 5: sandbox

### Navigate tmux Windows
- `Ctrl+b` then `0-5` = Switch to window 0-5
- `Ctrl+b` then `d` = Detach (session keeps running)
- `Ctrl+b` then `?` = Help

---

## 🎯 What You Can Do Right Now

### Option 1: View the Coordinator

```bash
tmux attach -t CodeAgency
# You'll see window 0 (coordinator)
# It's waiting for your commands
```

### Option 2: Give It a Task (Quick Test)

```bash
./send-claude-message.sh CodeAgency:0 "
Quick task: In the sandbox window (window 5), create a simple Python script that prints 'Hello from CodeAgency!'
Just demonstrate you can work across windows.
"
```

### Option 3: Real Work

```bash
./send-claude-message.sh CodeAgency:0 "
TASK: Build a simple FastAPI application
Location: /tmp/hello-api/
Requirements:
- Single endpoint: GET /hello returns {'message': 'Hello World'}
- Include requirements.txt
- Include a test file
- Document how to run it

Deploy your python-agent to window 1 and have them build this.
When done, test it in the sandbox window.
"
```

## 📚 Documentation (Read in Order)

1. **START_HERE.md** ← You are here
2. **CURRENT_STATE.md** - Detailed state, what's running, how everything works
3. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Command cheat sheet
4. **AGENCY_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Full design and philosophy

## 🚨 Quick Commands

```bash
# See what's running
tmux ls

# Attach to CodeAgency
tmux attach -t CodeAgency

# Peek at coordinator without attaching
tmux capture-pane -t CodeAgency:0 -p | tail -50

# Send message to coordinator
./send-claude-message.sh CodeAgency:0 "Your message"

# Check message queue
python3 tools/message_bus.py pending CodeAgency

# Create another agency
./scripts/create_agency.sh QAAgency \
  --agents test-lead,qa-engineer \
  --capabilities testing,qa
```

---

## 🧠 Context Persistence

**YES**, context persists! The coordinator:
- ✅ Knows it's the CodeAgency coordinator
- ✅ Knows about its team (python-agent, js-agent, code-reviewer)
- ✅ Knows its capabilities (backend, frontend, api-design, code-review)
- ✅ Has access to the message bus and registry
- ✅ Can deploy agents and coordinate work

Just give it tasks and it will work!

---

## 🔍 System Status

```bash
# Quick health check
cd /home/sauly/dev/Tmux-Orchestrator

# 1. Check tmux sessions
tmux ls
# Should show: CodeAgency: 6 windows

# 2. Check registry
cat registry/active_agencies.json | jq '.agencies[].name'
# Should show: "CodeAgency"

# 3. Check coordinator is responsive
tmux capture-pane -t CodeAgency:0 -p | tail -20
# Should show Claude interface with coordinator ready

# 4. Check message queue
python3 tools/message_bus.py get CodeAgency
# Shows messages (1 exists from testing)
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always check state first**: `tmux capture-pane -t CodeAgency:0 -p | tail -30`
2. **Give explicit instructions**: Coordinators work best with clear, specific tasks
3. **Start simple**: Test with one task before complex workflows
4. **Watch the logs**: `tail -f agencies/CodeAgency/logs/activity.log`
5. **Use the scripts**: They handle timing and logging automatically

---

## 🆘 If Something Looks Wrong

```bash
# Is CodeAgency running?
tmux has-session -t CodeAgency 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Running" || echo "❌ Not found"

# Is coordinator responsive?
tmux capture-pane -t CodeAgency:0 -p | tail -10

# If stuck, send escape
tmux send-keys -t CodeAgency:0 Escape

# Nuclear option: restart coordinator
tmux kill-window -t CodeAgency:0
tmux new-window -t CodeAgency:0 -n coordinator \
  -c /home/sauly/dev/Tmux-Orchestrator/agencies/CodeAgency
tmux send-keys -t CodeAgency:0 'claude' Enter
sleep 5
./send-claude-message.sh CodeAgency:0 "$(cat agencies/CodeAgency/coordinator.md)"
```

---

## 🎬 Your First Steps

1. **Open terminal** on the physical machine
2. **Navigate**: `cd /home/sauly/dev/Tmux-Orchestrator`
3. **Attach**: `tmux attach -t CodeAgency`
4. **See coordinator** in window 0 (should be waiting for you)
5. **Give it a task** (see "Option 2" or "Option 3" above)
6. **Watch it work!**
