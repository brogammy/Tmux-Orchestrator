- Capabilities: backend, frontend, api-design, code-review
- Agents: python-agent, js-agent, code-reviewer
- Status: ‚úÖ Running and tested

## Documentation
- AGENCY_ARCHITECTURE.md: Complete design and philosophy
- CURRENT_STATE.md: Current system state and operational status
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Command cheat sheet
- START_HERE.md: Quick start for new sessions
- Updated CLAUDE.md with agency system instructions

## Features
